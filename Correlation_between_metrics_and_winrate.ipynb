    "Analysis: For a specific player or a group of players, calculate the percentage of total points scored by that player(s) in a game or over a season. This can provide insights into the offensive contribution of individual players to their team's overall scoring.\n",
    "These analyses can help you understand the relationship between player performance and team success, which can be valuable for making data-driven decisions, such as optimizing player rotations, evaluating player contracts, or predicting team performance in upcoming games or seasons."
